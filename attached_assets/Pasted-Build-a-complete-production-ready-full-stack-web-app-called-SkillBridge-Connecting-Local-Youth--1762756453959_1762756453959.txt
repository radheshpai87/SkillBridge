Build a complete, production-ready full-stack web app called 🌱 SkillBridge: Connecting Local Youth to Micro-Opportunities using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with simple, beginner-friendly code.

🧩 Overview:

SkillBridge connects college students and local youth who have skills (like content creation, tutoring, design, etc.) with small businesses or individuals who need short-term help for affordable gigs.

🎯 Core Features:

User Authentication (Students & Businesses):

Signup and login using JWT authentication.

Two roles: "student" and "business".

Store hashed passwords with bcrypt.

Profile Management:

Students: name, email, skills, short bio.

Businesses: name, email, company name, description.

Gig Management (CRUD):

Businesses can post gigs (title, description, budget, location).

Students can view all gigs and apply.

Matching System:

Simple keyword-based matching: show gigs that include the student’s skills in title/description.

Chat System (optional):

Use Socket.io for real-time chat between student and business (optional for MVP).

Rating System (optional):

After gig completion, both sides can leave feedback and ratings.

⚙️ Tech Stack:

Frontend: React (JSX only, no TypeScript), React Router, Axios for API calls, Context API for auth state.

Backend: Node.js, Express.js, JWT for auth, bcryptjs for hashing.

Database: MongoDB Atlas (via Mongoose).

Optional: Socket.io for chat.

📦 Backend Functionality:

User Model (User.js):

const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  email: { type: String, unique: true },
  password: String,
  role: { type: String, enum: ["student", "business"], required: true },
  skills: [String],
  bio: String,
  companyName: String,
  description: String
});
module.exports = mongoose.model("User", userSchema);


Gig Model (Gig.js):

const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const gigSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: String,
  description: String,
  budget: Number,
  location: String,
  postedBy: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "User" },
  applicants: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "User" }]
});
module.exports = mongoose.model("Gig", gigSchema);


Auth Routes (authRoutes.js):

/register

/login

Gig Routes (gigRoutes.js):
